A machine learning project that analyzes tweets and predicts whether they express positive or negative sentiment using the Sentiment140 dataset.

# Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

This is a personal project where I built a machine learning model to classify tweets as **positive** or **negative** using the **Sentiment140 dataset**.  
I applied text preprocessing techniques (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.) and trained a **Logistic Regression classifier** to detect sentiment.
